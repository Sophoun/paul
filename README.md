# PAUL

PAUL means personal Android utility library. It's a collection of utility classes that
I have combined as a single binary to make it easy to customize and up to date for my all of my personal
project.

Note: To be honest I'm poor of writing test, so this project doesn't include test and don't yell at me because of this reason.
